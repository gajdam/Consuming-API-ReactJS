# Consuming JSONPlaceholder fake API using react.js

This is a project for testing and optimizing the code in computer science studies.
This project uses [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) to display posts, comments and photo albums on the page, but the most important goal is to test and optimize elements of this project.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
